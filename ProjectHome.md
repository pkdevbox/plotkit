# PlotKit - Javascript Chart Plotting Library #

PlotKit is an easy to use Javascript Chart Plotting Library that runs entirely on the client side. It is based on top of the HTML CANVAS tag which is supported in Firefox, Safari and Opera, and is available under emulation on IE6 and IE7 via the [ExplorerCanvas](http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/).

Alternatively, preliminary SVG support is also available.
